# Micro Gutter Message

Navigate through the BufPane gutter messages and display them in a tooltip.

## ‚ùì How to use it

Insert in the command bar `> gutter_message` and hit `ENTER`; by default, the plugin will go to the next message.

### Options

> Use tab to **autocomplete plugin options**.

- `next`: Go to the next message from the current location.
- `prev`: Go to the previous message from the current location.
- `dnext`: Go to the next message from the current location and display the tooltip.
- `dprev`: Go to the previous message from the current location and display the tooltip.
- `display`: Display the tooltip.

## üé® Syntax and Colorscheme

To improve readability, a custom syntax and colorscheme are provided until Micro allows customization of colorschemes per buffer.

You can add the following line at the end of your current colorscheme: `include gutter-message`. **I recommend using a custom colorscheme** that includes both your main colorscheme and this one.

```
# custom-colorscheme.micro
include "YOUR_MAIN_COLORSCHEME"
include "gutter-message"
include "autocomplete-tooltip" # üëÄ
```

You can **change the colors** inside `colorschemes/gutter-message.micro`.

## üì¶ Installation

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT change the name of the plugin directory**.  It is used as a prefix to avoid path collisions in `package.path` when requiring modules.

You can install this from the [unofficial micro plugin channel](https://github.com/Neko-Box-Coder/unofficial-plugin-channel) by adding the following to your `settings.json`

```json
"pluginchannels": [
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neko-Box-Coder/unofficial-plugin-channel/main/channel.json"
]
```

Then do `micro -plugin install gutter_message`.

Alternatively, you can copy/clone this directly to your `.config/micro/plug`.

In Linux, you can copy/clone the repo anywhere and create a symlink inside `.config/micro/plug` using the `ENABLE_FOR_MICRO.sh` script.
